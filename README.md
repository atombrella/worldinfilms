# World in films

This is an attempt at finding a project that would let me toy around more with Ansible and
Wagtail. I like movies, and thought it would be a good starting point for a website.

Please feel free to use the Ansible files for inspiration for a Django related deployment.

The website runs on a DigitalOcean droplet, backed by a Ubuntu Xenial distribution.
